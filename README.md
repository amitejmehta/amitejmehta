# Welcome to My Portfolio

This repository is first part of my commitment to diving deeper into NLP as well as lifelong learning. The second are my Anki flashcards! I am a huge proponent of using space repition to learn and retain information. See a wonderful article on this from Michael Nielsen here: https://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html.

In this repostiory, you'll find some PyTorch implementations of popular transformer papers in `implementing-transformers`. 

Also, check out my app on hugging face spaces app at https://huggingface.co/spaces/amitej-mehta/token-distribution-viz to easily view the distribution of tokens when performing generations with a Language Model (GPT-2). A copy of the code to generate tokens and sample also exists in this repo in `fine-tuning`.

Lastly, in `practice_problems` I have my interview prep, such as `mi_1.ipynb` where I practice writing training loops and building small nets for speed, or `tensor_puzzles` where I solve basic tensor puzzles created by GPT-4 in order to decrease the tensor related errors when training neural nets. I have found this kind of timed practice to be highly effective towards mastering PyTorch.
